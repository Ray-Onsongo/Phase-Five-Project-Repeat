## Project Overview

The Job Market Intelligence System is designed to address the fragmented and opaque nature of today’s job market by transforming raw job posting data into actionable, real-time insights for job seekers, HR professionals, and educators. By analyzing English-language technical and professional job postings, the system identifies in-demand and declining skills, maps geographic hiring hotspots, benchmarks salaries by role and experience, and classifies emerging job trends. Its goal is to reduce information overload for job seekers, improve competitive hiring and compensation alignment for recruiters, and enable data-driven curriculum updates for educational institutions. Success will be measured through strong technical performance, such as over 80% job classification `accuracy` and salary prediction `MAE` below $15,000, alongside the delivery of clear, practical insights that support smarter career, hiring, and educational decisions.

## 1. Business Problem

The modern job market operates in a fragmented and opaque environment where critical information about skill demand, compensation benchmarks, and geographic opportunities is scattered across thousands of job postings. This lack of centralized, data-driven insight creates inefficiencies for **job seekers** making career decisions, **HR professionals** competing for talent, and **educational institutions** attempting to align curricula with market needs. Without a unified intelligence system, stakeholders rely on incomplete or outdated information, leading to misaligned skills, uncompetitive salary offers, prolonged hiring cycles, and graduates entering the workforce unprepared for current demand.
